## About The Project

   With this little program you can host a server on your own computer and then access it from any device by connecting to a given website.
    You can add the local path to a program <"C:\Desktop\name\program\somehting.exe"> and a button will be added to your website where you can click on it and the program will open on your computer.  

## Built With

This was build using NodeJS, HTML,

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zKlau/ComputerWebRemoteControl.git
```

2. Start the server

```sh
node server.js
```

3. Host the website
Create a text file and type ```lt --port 3000 -s  websiteName``` (type whater name you want instead of websiteName) then save the file as ```.bat```

## Usage

You can use this to create shortcuts and access them from your phone or any device. In the future I want to add video and image support so you can stop and play videos. For now you can only open programs and webpages. 

## Roadmap

- Image & Video support
- Send text from device to the host
- Plugin support
- Better interface
